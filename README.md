# Atlatl

An example of a multiplatform Kotlin application
  - Backend: [Javalin.io](https://javalin.io/), to make js devs feel at home
  - Frontend: React, to make js devs feel at home ;)


## Tour

The src folder at the root level contains common data classes that are shared between the backend and the frontend so no matter what, you know what data you're getting.

The frontend code uses the kotlin front end plugin to manage the webpack bundling and the dev server. 


### What's an atlatl?

Its a tool that launches javelins. This project was originally focused on just the Javalin server part which is why its named the way it is.
